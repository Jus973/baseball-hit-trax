# baseball-tracker
Made for our AP CS final project

Three part project: 
1. Using computer vision, track a baseball's location and feed its coordinates / size to another file
2. Calculate the ball's projected path 
3. Graph the ball on a 3D GUI - we decided to do this part by scratch, hence the large amount of files.
